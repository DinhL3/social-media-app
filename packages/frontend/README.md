# Frontend

## Introduction
Our frontend is made with React TypeScript, Router, Redux, Material UI.

## Material UI Components
We use Material UI Components instead of plain HTML & CSS due to limited time budget.
Details on how to add, customize, style components can be found on Material documentation. Just search for example `Material list`.
Try to find MUI components that suit your needs first before using simple html tags, since those already have responsive formatting built in. E.g. `<Typography variant="h3"/>` instead of `<h3>`.
They are very specific on how to change their button color, components pallete, so try to find a solution there since in many cases, try to change things using in-line css e.g. `sx={{background: 'red'}}` does not work.
